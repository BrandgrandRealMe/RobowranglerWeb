=== "Technical Skills"
    Using the technical skills they develop on the team, Robowrangler students intern with local tech companies while still in high school; they do product development and design work before ever attending college.

=== "Soft Skills"
    Robowrangler students get the chance to practice the “soft skills” they need to be successful in the modern workplace. While many companies are struggling to find employees with these skills, our students are crafted into workforce-ready leaders who have mastered the concepts of problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork.

=== "Life Lessons"
    Perhaps most importantly, Robowrangler students are given the chance to solve very difficult problems. This competition is sometimes described as “the hardest fun you’ll ever have.”
    When you spend your time solving problems, you spend a lot of time with failure. This is where Robowranglers receive the hardest lessons, and the team can provide its biggest impact.
